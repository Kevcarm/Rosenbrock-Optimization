# Rosenbrock Optimization

We will be using the Rosenbrock function to do an optimization problem for the project. 
There is a set of evolutionary algorithms that are going to be analyzed with how they interact with 
our function. Along with analyzing how our algorithms interact with the function and how they 
compare to one another, we will also be testing for how changing the dimension parameter affects 
our output.
