# Rosenbrock Optimization

We will be using the Rosenbrock function to do an optimization problem for the project. 
The function will be evaluated in multiple quantities of dimensions using different variations of Simulated Annealing and (1+1)EA.
The aim is to compare the performance of these algorithms and how they compare in terms of finding the best optimized answer and how fast that may take.
