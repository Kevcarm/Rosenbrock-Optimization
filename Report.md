	The problem that was decided on for the project was a optimization problem with the Rosenbrock function. Rosenbrock is mathematical optimization that is a non-convex functon, introduced by Howard H. Rosenbrock in 1960. It is used as a performance test problem for optimization algorithms. The function can be used by it effiently optimized by adapting appropiate coordinate systems without using any gradient information and without building local approximation models. It's a popular choice to pick for testing algorithms because it is easy to follow the valley of the function down, but it is hard to find its local minima.
	
	Rosenbrock was choosen seemed like it was a function a lot documentiation behind it and only had one global minima but was hard to find. Using Rosenbrock with a optimization problem would allow us to test evolutionary computations with it to see which one could find the global minima in the shortest amount of time. For this, four evolutionary computations were palnned to be used for this problem. These were simulated annealing, (1+1) EA, randomized hill climbing, and tabu search. These were choose as they seemed best fit to find the global minima in the Rosenbrock function. In the end, only two of the four evolutionary computations were used to test which could be the fastest to fine the global minima.
	
	The evolutionary computation that were used for the Rosenbrock function were simulated annealing and (1+1) EA. Simulated Annealing was used to help test Rosenbrock for the global minima, same thing went with the (1+1) EA. The reason these were chosen was because they were the only ones that worked for the real value function. The other two that were orignally planned to be used but were not were randomized hill climbing and tabu search. Randomized hill climbing had to be cut because it mainly worked well for discrete values. This meant that finding the minima in a Rosenbrock function would not work with it. For tabu search, it does not work well with valley functions. Rosenbrock is a valley function, and after some research for tabu search it was decided it would not work with finding the minima in the optimization problem.
